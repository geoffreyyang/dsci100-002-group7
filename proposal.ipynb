    "To predict the weather, government agencies divide Earth's entire atmosphere into thousands of rectangular cells: for each cell, they feed in millions of current weather observations into powerful supercomputers, generating forecasts than are refreshed several times a day<sup>1</sup>. But what if the goal was not to predict \"the weather\", but simply to predict *whether or not it will rain tomorrow*? Can this simple yet valuable question be answered accurately using easier-to-understand variables, fewer data points, and at much less computational expense?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to answer the question, ***which broad weather variable, when measured today, is most predictive of rain tomorrow?*** By \"broad\", we mean ideas of \"temperature\" and \"windiness\" rather than \"temperature at 3 pm\" and \"maximum wind gust speed\". These broad variables are things the average person would have an intuitive sense of or at the least look up quickly: if we find one that is strongly associated with rainfall, it could serve as a useful heuristic for predicting rain in our daily lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the \"Rain in Australia\" dataset, publicly avaialable on Kaggle<sup>2</sup>. It contains more than 140,000 weather observations gathered from locations across Australia over a span of 10 years. Each row contains temperature, rainfall, wind, humidity, pressure, and cloud cover measurements for the day. The target variable is `RainTomorrow`, a Boolean: `Yes` if it rained at least 1 mm the day after, and `No` otherwise."

    "Examining the table and visualizations, it seems that pressure, humidity, temperature, wind speed, and cloud cover all have some relationship with `RainTomorrow`. They are all numeric variables and come in nice pairs of two variables (measurements taken at 9 am and 3 pm). Thus we plan to build five separate KNN classifiers to capture these 5 broad weather variables:\n",

    "\n",
    "We will not use `Date`, `Location`, or any of the wind direction variables since we don't know any modeling techniques that can combine numerical and categorical predictors. Although `MinTemp`, `MaxTemp`, and `WindGustSpeed` are perfectly fine numerical variables, we decided not to use them since we think the 9am and 3pm measurements are enough to capture \"temperature\" and \"windiness\" respectively and we would just be introducing unnecessary complexity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "After building and tuning each model for the best performance using 10-fold cross-validation, we will identify the most predictive single weather variable for `RainTomorrow`. Next, we will build a classifier that uses all the numeric variables in the dataset as predictors. The purpose will be to compare the effectiveness of our chosen \"heuristic\" rain predictor with the \"best accuracy\" we can achieve from our data. Since KNN gets slow with many predictors, we might choose a different, more efficient algorithm. Finally, we will compare these two results to the \"dumb approach\" of predicting it will rain tomorrow if it rained today, and vice-versa, to see how much improvement our models can make.  \n",

We expect that the classifier incorporating all the numeric variables as predictors will perform better, but not *that* much better considering the additional computational expense. We expect both approaches to be better than simply predicting it will rain tomorrow if it rained today and vice-versa.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to know if it will rain tomorrow, most of us just check the weather forecast on our phones. Still, finding one or two variables highly associated with rain tomorrow could be useful whenever we are unable or forgot to check the forecast. Plus, most forecasts put a percentage on the chance of rain, so having a sense of what variables drive those percentages could be useful. But the most significant outcome will be that we are able to predict rain tomorrow accurately despite using *way* less computer muscle and raw data than what is fed into weather models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This would raise a few questions for future exploration. If we were able to be accurate with limited computing power, are there more computationally efficient methods available to meteorologists if they *only* had to forecast rain? If rain can be predicted with just a few variables, how many sensors are truly *necessary* to be installed in weather stations? Finally, how effective would our approach be at predicting the *amount* of rainfall tomorrow - regression?"
