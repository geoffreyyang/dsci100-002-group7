    "To predict the weather, government agencies divide Earth's atmosphere into thousands of 3D cells: for each cell, they feed millions of current weather observations into powerful supercomputers, generating forecasts which must be refreshed several times a day<sup>1</sup>. But what if the goal was not to predict \"the weather\", but simply to predict *whether or not it will rain tomorrow*? Can this less ambitious question be answered accurately using simpler variables, fewer data points, and less computational horsepower?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to answer the question, ***which broad weather variable, when measured today, is most predictive of rain tomorrow?*** By \"broad\", we mean ideas of \"temperature\" and \"windiness\" rather than \"temperature at 3 pm\" and \"maximum wind gust speed\". These broad variables are things the average person would have an intuitive sense of or could search up quickly: the hope is to find a simple variable that can serve as an effective heuristic for predicting rain in our daily lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the **\"Rain in Australia\"** dataset, publicly avaialable on Kaggle<sup>2</sup>. It contains more than 140,000 weather observations gathered from locations across Australia over a span of 10 years. Each row contains temperature, rainfall, wind, humidity, pressure, and cloud cover measurements for the day. The target variable is `RainTomorrow`, a Boolean: `Yes` if it rained at least 1 mm the day after, and `No` otherwise."

Next, we will build a classifier that integrates all the numeric variables in the dataset as predictors. This will let us compare the effectiveness of our chosen \"heuristic\" variable with the \"best accuracy\" we can achieve from our data. Since KNN gets slow with many predictors, we might choose a different, more efficient algorithm. Finally, we will compare these two results to the \"naive approach\" of predicting it will rain tomorrow if it rained today, and vice-versa, to see how much value our models actually have in a real-world setting.  \n",

But the most significant outcome will predicting rain accurately despite using *significantly* less computing power and data than contemporary weather models.  \n",

Finally, how effective would our approach be at regression, predicting the *amount* of rainfall tomorrow?"
