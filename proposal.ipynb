    "To predict the weather, meteorologists slice Earth's atmosphere vertically and horizontally into thousands of 3D cells: for each cell, they feed millions of current weather observations into powerful supercomputers to forecast future changes<sup>1</sup>. But what if the goal was not to predict \"*the weather*\", but simply to predict *whether or not it will rain tomorrow*? Can this simple yet valuable question be answered accurately using easily-understood variables, fewer daily observations, and minimal computational expense?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to answer the question, ***which broad weather variable, when measured today, is most predictive of rain tomorrow?*** By \"broad\", we mean ideas of \"temperature\" and \"windiness\" rather than \"temperature at 3 am\" and \"maximum wind gust speed\" - we mean ideas that the average person could look out for and get a sense of. If we find a highly predictive broad weather variable, it could serve as a useful heuristic in our daily lives.\n",

    "We will use the \"Rain in Australia\" dataset, publicly avaialable on Kaggle<sup>2</sup>. It contains more than 140,000 weather observations gathered from locations across Australia over a span of 10 years. Each row contains temperature, rainfall, wind, humidity, pressure, sunshine, and cloud cover measurements for the day. While there are thousands of N/As, all 140k rows have a Boolean value for the target variable - `RainTomorrow`, `Yes` if it rained more than 1 mm the day after, and `No` otherwise."
