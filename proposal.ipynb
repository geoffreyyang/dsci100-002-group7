    "To predict the weather, government agencies divide Earth's entire atmosphere into thousands of rectangular cells: for each cell, they feed millions of current weather observations into powerful supercomputers to generate forecasts, repeating this process four times a day<sup>1</sup>. But what if the goal was not to predict \"the weather\", but simply to predict *whether or not it will rain tomorrow*? Can this simple yet valuable question be answered accurately using easily-understood variables, fewer data points, and at minimal computational expense?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to answer the question, ***which broad weather variable, when measured today, is most predictive of rain tomorrow?*** By \"broad\", we mean ideas like \"temperature\" and \"windiness\" rather than \"temperature at 3 pm\" and \"maximum wind gust speed\". These broad variables are things the average person could get a sense of as they go about their lives: if we find one that is strongly associated with rainfall, it could serve as a useful heuristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the \"Rain in Australia\" dataset, publicly avaialable on Kaggle<sup>2</sup>. It contains more than 140,000 weather observations gathered from locations across Australia over a span of 10 years. Each row contains temperature, rainfall, wind, humidity, pressure, and cloud cover measurements for the day. Although there are thousands of N/As, all rows have a Boolean value for the target variable, `RainTomorrow`: `Yes` if it rained at least 1 mm the day after, and `No` otherwise."
